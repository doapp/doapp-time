# **DEPRECATED**

This library is no longer needed as jsr310 or threetenbp both have support for a Clock interface.  See [the data project](https://github.com/doapp/mln-data) for the time-util project that has a MutableClock that can be used for testing

## doapp-time
Java library for managing time with Clock support.
